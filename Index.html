        <h3>Fact 1:</h3>
        <p>I have way too many consoles and video games, most of which I either haven't finished or 
            haven't played at all! I have about 8 different consoles, 4 hand-helds, and a gaming PC. 
            I actually don't spend a lot of time gaming, but when I do I tend to go all out and will 
            play the games for 10+ hours a day for like 2 solid weeks.
        </p>

        <h3>Fact 2:</h3>
        <p>I love posters and art, mostly from comic books and video games. I do not
            like having just "official game art", I usually prefer concept art or art from Indie 
            developers. But I also have way too many posters and not enough wall space for them so 
            they just sit in poster tubes until I decide to play tetris on my walls again.
        </p>

        <h3>Fact 3:</h3>
        <p>I tend to get obsessive with Indie Developers and tend to just play their games and focus
            on those. Although I am an avid Zelda fan, I do tend to prefer indie games. Right now I am
            currently obsessed with Supergiant Games and Night School Studio. Especially the art and 
            music from supergiant games (the transistor soundtrack is my go-to for when I'm coding).
        </p>

        <h3>Fact 4:</h3>
        <p>Baking! I love to bake! I actually make commission cakes/cupcakes/treats as sort of a 
            supplement income thing. I started really getting into baking about 3 years ago and
            I picked up on it really quickly. I spent a good while researching the chemistry behind
            baking because I wanted to make my recipers perfect, and I feel like I've done it.
            It low-key drives my friends insane when they try to bake with me because I am so percise
            and often times don't let them do anything.
